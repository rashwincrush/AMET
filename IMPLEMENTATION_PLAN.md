4. Write tests for critical functionality
5. Perform code review and quality checks
6. Deploy and test in staging environment
7. Document the feature

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for critical components and functions
- Integration tests for API routes
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Accessibility testing
- Performance testing

### Deployment Strategy
- Continuous integration with GitHub Actions
- Staging environment for feature testing
