# Two-Factor Authentication Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using Supabase Auth's built-in email code verification to enhance security for the Alumni Management System.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. User Settings Interface
- Create a dedicated security section in the user settings page
- Add a toggle for enabling/disabling 2FA
- Include explanatory text about the benefits of 2FA
- Add UI for setting up backup email for recovery

### 2. Authentication Flow Integration
- Modify the login process to check if 2FA is enabled for the user
- Create a verification code input screen that appears after successful password verification
- Implement a "Remember this device" option to reduce friction for trusted devices
- Add clear error handling for failed verifications

### 3. Recovery Process
- Implement a simple recovery process using backup email
- Create a recovery code generation and verification system
- Add account recovery documentation and help text

## Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Add 2FA related columns to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS two_factor_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS recovery_email TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS trusted_devices JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb;
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters email/password
2. If credentials are valid and 2FA is enabled:
   - Generate and send verification code to user's email
   - Redirect to verification code input screen
3. User enters verification code
4. If code is valid:
   - Complete login process
   - Update trusted devices list if "Remember this device" is selected

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/enable-2fa`: Enable 2FA for a user
- `POST /api/auth/disable-2fa`: Disable 2FA for a user
- `POST /api/auth/verify-2fa`: Verify 2FA code during login
- `POST /api/auth/recovery-email`: Set or update recovery email
- `POST /api/auth/generate-recovery`: Generate recovery code
- `POST /api/auth/recover-account`: Recover account using backup email

## UI Components

### Settings Page
- Security section with 2FA toggle
- Recovery email input field
- Last login information display

### Verification Screen
- Code input field with clear formatting
- Resend code option with countdown timer
- "Remember this device" checkbox
- Cancel button to return to login

### Recovery Process
- Recovery option on login screen
- Recovery email verification
- New password and 2FA setup after recovery

## Testing Plan
1. Test enabling/disabling 2FA
2. Test login flow with 2FA enabled
3. Test "Remember this device" functionality
4. Test recovery process
5. Test error handling for invalid codes
6. Test timeout and rate limiting

## Security Considerations
- Implement rate limiting for verification attempts
- Add timeout for verification codes (5-10 minutes)
- Notify users via email when 2FA settings are changed
- Log all 2FA-related activities
- Implement device fingerprinting for trusted devices

## Rollout Plan
1. Develop and test in staging environment
2. Beta test with admin users
3. Add feature flag for gradual rollout
4. Full deployment with in-app notifications
5. Monitor for any issues or user feedback
