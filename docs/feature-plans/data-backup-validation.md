# Data Backup & Validation Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive data backup, validation, and restore system for the Alumni Management System using Supabase database functions and storage capabilities.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Manual Backup Trigger
- Create an admin settings page with backup controls
- Implement backup scheduling options (manual, daily, weekly)
- Add progress indicators and success/failure notifications
- Include backup history with metadata (timestamp, size, creator)

### 2. Data Validation Checks
- Implement validation for critical data fields across all tables
- Create a validation dashboard showing data integrity status
- Add automatic validation before backup creation
- Include detailed error reporting for invalid data

### 3. Restore Functionality
- Create a restore interface with backup selection
- Implement transaction-based restore operations
- Add restore preview showing changes to be made
- Include partial restore options for specific tables

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
-- Create backups table to track backup metadata
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS backups (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  file_size BIGINT,
  tables TEXT[] NOT NULL,
  record_counts JSONB NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL,
  validation_results JSONB,
  notes TEXT
);

-- Add RLS policies
ALTER TABLE backups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Only super_admin and admin can access backups
CREATE POLICY "Admins can access backups"
  ON backups
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles ur
      JOIN roles r ON ur.role_id = r.id
      WHERE ur.profile_id = auth.uid()
      AND r.name IN ('super_admin', 'admin')
    )
  );
```

### Backup Process Flow
1. Admin initiates backup through admin interface
2. System performs data validation checks
3. If validation passes (or admin overrides), system generates SQL dump
4. Backup file is stored in Supabase Storage (backups bucket)
5. Metadata is recorded in backups table
6. Admin receives notification of completion

### Validation Checks
- **Profiles Table**:
  - Email format validation
  - Required fields check (first_name, last_name)
  - Relationship integrity with user_roles

- **Events Table**:
  - Date integrity (start_date before end_date)
  - Required fields check (title, description)
  - Capacity validation (positive number)

- **Jobs Table**:
  - Date integrity (expires_at in future)
  - Required fields check (title, company_name)
  - Relationship integrity with profiles

### Restore Process Flow
1. Admin selects backup from history
2. System presents preview of data to be restored
3. Admin selects tables to restore or opts for full restore
4. System creates a temporary backup of current data
5. System executes restore in a transaction
6. If successful, admin is notified; if failed, system rolls back

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/backups/create`: Create a new backup
- `GET /api/admin/backups`: List all backups
- `GET /api/admin/backups/:id`: Get backup details
- `POST /api/admin/backups/:id/restore`: Restore from a backup
- `DELETE /api/admin/backups/:id`: Delete a backup
- `GET /api/admin/validate`: Run validation checks without backup

## UI Components

### Backup Dashboard
- Backup history table with metadata
- Create backup button with options
- Validation status indicators
- Download backup option

### Validation Interface
- Table-by-table validation status
- Error details with record identifiers
- Fix suggestions where applicable
- Export validation report option

### Restore Interface
- Backup selection dropdown
- Table selection checkboxes
- Preview of data changes
- Confirmation dialog with warnings

## Security Considerations
- Restrict backup/restore operations to super_admin and admin roles
- Encrypt backup files in transit and at rest
- Log all backup and restore operations
- Implement rate limiting for backup operations
- Ensure backup files are not publicly accessible

## Testing Plan
1. Test backup creation with valid and invalid data
2. Test validation checks across all tables
3. Test restore functionality with various backup sizes
4. Test partial restores of specific tables
5. Test error handling and rollback mechanisms
6. Test concurrent backup/restore operations

## Deployment Plan
1. Create the backups table and storage bucket
2. Implement backup functionality first
3. Add validation checks
4. Implement restore functionality
5. Deploy to staging for testing
6. Roll out to production with admin training
